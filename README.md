# Skeleton Ui Screen

## What’s Unique About A Skeleton Screen?

A skeleton UI resembles the page’s actual UI, so users will understand how quickly the web or mobile app will load even before the content has shown up. Here are a couple of reasons why you might want to consider using skeleton screens in your next project:

- mimicking a page’s layout is easier with a skeleton screen,
- contents loads progressively (not all at once).

Skeleton screens are also referred to as:

- ghost elements,
- content placeholders,
- content loaders.

Blockchain.com, YouTube, Facebook, Medium, and other big tech companies display skeleton screens while their content loads to boost the UX.

#### Types Of Skeleton Screens

There are different kinds of skeleton screens. The major ones are text placeholders and image (or color) placeholders.

Most developers prefer to use text placeholders as the skeleton UI on their pages because they’re easy to build, and the developer doesn’t require any details about the substance of the actual content; instead the skeleton mimics the UI.

Color placeholders are harder to build because they require details about the content.

Some popular packages make implementing skeleton screens in web apps easier. Let’s take a closer look at both of them:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
